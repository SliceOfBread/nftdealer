# <a name="README"> NFT Dealer (an online clone of The Gallerist)

This is an online clone of the great board game The Gallerist. **It is not affiliated
with Eagle-Gryphon Games or Vital Lacerda in any way.**

**Buy The Board Game**

The board game is great and this repository highly recommends [purchasing it](https://www.eaglegames.net/The-Gallerist-Complete-Bundle-p/102322.htm) for personal use.

## ⬤ I want to play!
You can play solo against bot(s) at [this link](https://sliceofbread.neocities.org/nftdealer/botplayer.html). This play 100% in the browser. The bots play better in a 4P (3 bots vs 1 human) than a 2P game.

I set this up with the intention that it could be deployed on herokuapp. With the free hobby version of that going away I doubt I'll write instructions for that.

## ⬤ I want to learn how to play
Search YouTube for videos.

## ✨ Contributors ✨

Many thanks to the contributors to [the online open-source version of Terraformaing Mars](https://github.com/terraforming-mars/terraforming-mars/blob/main/README.md). Many of the ideas regarding client-server interface, player/game IDs, heroku use and even the basis of this README came from them.
